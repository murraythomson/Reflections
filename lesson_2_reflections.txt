What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git sets up its hidden folder and the necessary files for making commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The working directory holds all the files, both going to be committed and
  not committed.

  The staging area holds ONLY those files that are going to be committed.

  The repository holds the information on the files that have been committed,
  but not those that haven't been committed from the working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  You can use the staging area to hold all the files that been changed for the
  specific logical change before commiting them.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  Branches are useful when testing an experimental feature that might not become
  a part of the main project. They keep things separate.
