How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By cutting out everything that wasn't different

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Being able to step backwards to see where bugs began occurring.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Can test code before saving it
    Cons: Might lose some work if file becomes lost or damaged.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because most programs contain multiple files that are needed.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log to see the commit logs, and diff to compare files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It will make you more confident because you can always undo the changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Keeping a version controlled development project.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  Being able to re-use code, see the entire history of development, and debug
  better, and to see why changes were made!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like
Google Docs does?

    Asked to add the same question?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
 separately?

    Because for most projects the files will be linked together, so it's
    important to see all changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log is used to display all the commits, and the associated comments.
    Git diff can be used to show the differences between two files, showing
    the number of lines added and subtracted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By knowing that you can always easily revert to a previous version, I can
    have confidence that major or minor changes can be undone!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Creating a webpage using html and css, and using Git to keep track of the
    changes.
